mod-d7-royalslider
==================

Provides Drupal integration for the [Royal Slider](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/) jQuery library.

Would ideally provide:

* Field formatter
* Views display plugin
* CTools/Features exportable optionsets

*HOWEVER*, it's not working yet, so go back to 1.x :)
